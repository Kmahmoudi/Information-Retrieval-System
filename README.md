# Information-Retrieval-System
This project contains c++ source code for an Information retrieval system which uses the cran dataset (http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/cran/) for generating Word-Document index with sql server which can then answer to user's information need by conjunctive and disjunctive queries.
